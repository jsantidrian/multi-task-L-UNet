This repository includes the code for the following manuscript:

'A Deep Multi-Task Learning Framework Coupling Semantic Segmentation and Fully Convolutional LSTM Networks for Urban Change Detection'

The proposed method has been implemented on the training images of SpaceNet7 dataset.

## Steps

1. Download the training images of SpaceNet7 dataset as described in: https://github.com/CosmiQ/CosmiQ_SN7_Baseline
   You should create a /train/ folder which will contain all SpaceNet7 60 folders of SpaceNet7 training images.
   
2. Preprocess data
   - Inside the /train/ folder put the following scripts:
